# DiSpace (unofficial API wrapper)

An unofficial .NET wrapper for a small part of the DiSpace API.

This repository hosts the following sub-projects:

- **[Extractor.](https://github.com/Abbysssal/DiSpace/tree/main/DiSpaceExtractor/WebEx.js)** Fetching data from the servers. *Still in the process of discovering new post actions.*
- **[Converter.](https://github.com/Abbysssal/DiSpace/tree/main/DiSpaceExtractor)** Converting the weird, unstable and excessive data format into something at least a bit manageable.
- **Database.** Storing the converted data in a database, for quick access. *Right now it's stored on my computer, but you can see the empty copy of the database [here](https://github.com/Abbysssal/DiSpace/tree/main/dispace-backup.sqlite) or interact with it via DiPeek.*
- **[API.](https://github.com/Abbysssal/DiSpace/tree/main/DiSpaceCore)** C# API for interacting with the database.
- **[DiPeek.](https://discord.gg/tphsh9vsty)** A Discord bot for searching the database. *Soon to be migrated to a Raspberry Pi to be accessed 24/7.*
